## Description
Is it possible to filter the Grid data with checkboxes?

I saw this is the jQuery version of the Grid. Is it support for React as well?

## Solution
In the KendoReact Grid this has to be achieved programmatically using the [ColumnMenu](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/grid/columns/column-menu/) component.

Please check an example demonstrating how this can be achieved:

{% meta id:index height:760 %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-filter-checkbox/main.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-filter-checkbox/customColumnMenu.jsx %}
{% embed_file common/products.json %}
{% endmeta %}
