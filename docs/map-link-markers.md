## Description

How can I draw a straight line between a marker and a location?

## Solution

1. Add [shape and marker layers]({% slug overview_layers_map %}) to the Map configuration.
1. Attach a handler to the [reset event]({% slug events_map %}) of the Map.
1. Create a method that will draw a line between a marker and a specified position.
1. Inside the method, retrieve the from and to coordinates for the line by using the [locationToView method]({% slug api_map_map %}#toc-locationtoview).
1. Get a reference to the shape layer so you can draw on its surface.
1. Draw the line by using the [Path element]({% slug api_kendo-drawing_path %}).

The following example demonstrates how to draw a straight line between a marker and a location.

{% meta height:700 %}
{% embed_file map/link-markers/main.tsx preview %}
{% endmeta %}
