## Environment

<table>
    <tbody>
	    <tr>
	    	<td>Product</td>
	    	<td>ProgressÂ® KendoReact</td>
	    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


## Description

How can I have control over the expand/collapse column of the KendoReact Grid and be able to change or hide the Grid columns?

## Solution

To modify the expand/collapse column of the Grid:

1. Create a custom column that is bound to the expanded field.
1. Show the icons conditionally.

For more information, refer to the following props:
* [`cell`]({% slug api_grid_gridcolumnprops %}#toc-cell)
* [`headerCell`]({% slug api_grid_gridcolumnprops %}#toc-headercell)

For the full implementation of the suggested approach, refer to the [demo on creating a custom expand/collapse column in the KendoReact Grid](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-abh1id-pwtfuf?file=app/main.jsx).
