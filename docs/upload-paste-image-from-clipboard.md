## Description

Do you have any idea how can I use Copy and Paste to automatically place pictures inside the React Upload Component?

I want to Copy a Picture using Ctrl+C from my computer, go to the browser and Paste it via Ctrl+V, if there is a React Upload Component on the page, I need it to automatically discover the Picture that I was holding on the Ctrl+C and place it inside the component for Uploading,

## Solution

This will require the following setup:

1. Add a `DIV` element that will be the paste zone.
1. Add an `onPaste` event listener to that `DIV`.
1. Handle the `onPaste` event to loop over the `clipboard data`.
1. If there are images in the clipboard data, load them into the Upload by `updating the state`.

This is an example showcasing this:

{% meta id:index height:760 %}
{% embed_file upload/paste-image/main.jsx preview %}
{% endmeta %}
