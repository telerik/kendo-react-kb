## Description

I need to provide mechanism for pasting data into my KendoReact Grid, from Excel sheets.

## Solution

This will require wrapping the Grid in a div element and attaching an `onPaste` event. Then on that event:
1. Take the data.
1. Transform it into JSON based on the Grid fields. 
1. Set that JSON array as Grid data.

This can be seen in the following example:

{% meta id:index height:760 %}
{% embed_file grid/paste-from-excel/main.jsx preview %}
{% endmeta %}
