## Description
I want my exported PDF document to have a watermark.

## Solution
This can be achieved by using the drawDom and exportPDF from the @progress/kendo-drawing package and then passing a template.

This is an example showcasing this approach:

{% meta id:index height:760 %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-pdf-export-with-watermark/main.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-pdf-export-with-watermark/products.json %}
{% endmeta %}
