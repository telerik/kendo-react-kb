## Description

How can I drag and drop item between two TreeList components?

## Solution

This requires the following:

1. Use the [rowRender]({% slug api_treelist_treelistprops %}#toc-rowrender) property of the TreeList to add the drag and drop events to the rows.
1. Save the dragged item in the state during the [onDragStart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/dragstart_event) event.
1. During the [onDrop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/ondrop) event update the data in both TreeList components.

This can be seen in action in the following example:

{% meta id height:760 %}
{% embed_file treelist/drag-and-drop/main.jsx preview %}
{% endmeta %}
