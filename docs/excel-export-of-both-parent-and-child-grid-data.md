## Description
I have a parent Grid with child Grids as details, how to export all to Excel.

## Solution
This requires using a chain of Promises to request the data for all child Grids and append it to the exported document after each parent row item.

This is an example showcasing this. The example contains comments for the most specific parts:

{% meta id:index height:760 %}
{% embed_file grid/excel-export-parent-child/main.jsx preview %}
{% endmeta %}
