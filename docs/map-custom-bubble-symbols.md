## Description

How can I add some custom symbols to the Bubble layer of the Map?

## Solution

The [Bubble Layer]({% slug bubble_layers_map %}) allows you to define the way symbols are rendered.
This approach works by defining a symbol function that uses the [Drawing API]({% slug overview_drawing %}) to define the shape. The symbol is typically a Group of shapes.

The following example demonstrates how to render 200-kilometer lines in West-East direction as a symbol.

> The lines get longer the farther you go North, which is due to that fact that the example uses the [Mercator Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection).
