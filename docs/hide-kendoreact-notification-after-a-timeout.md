## Description
How to hide the Notification component automatically after a specific timeout.

## Solution
Currently, this can be done using the setTimeout function as shown in the example below.

{% meta id:index height:760 %}
{% embed_file notification/hide-after/main.jsx preview %}
{% endmeta %}

Also, there is a feature request for this in our portal and I can suggest voting for it as it will increase its chances to be implemented as a built-in feature:
