## Description

How the close the Popup when clicking outside of it?

## Solution

This can be done by:

1. Add a focusable container in the Popup (the Popup has no tabIndex by default).
1. Focus the focusable container when the Popup is opened.
1. On the `onBlur` event of that element close the Popup.

This is an example showcasing this:

{% meta id:index height:760 %}
{% embed_file popup/close-on-blur/main.jsx preview %}
{% endmeta %}
