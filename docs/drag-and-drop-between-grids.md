## Description

I need to be able to drag and drop rows from one Grid to another.

## Solution

Use the [`rowRender`]({% slug api_grid_gridprops %}#toc-rowrender) prop of the Grid to attach the [onDragStart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/dragstart_event) and onDrop(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/drop_event) events to the row.
