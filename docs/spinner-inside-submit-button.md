## Description
I want to visualise a spinner icon once the form has been submitted.

## Solution
This can be achieved by using the iconClass props and conditionally changing the className to that of a spinner or loader based on the disabled variable.

This is an example showcasing this approach:

{% meta id:index height:760 %}
{% embed_file form/spinner-inside-submit-button/main.jsx preview %}
{% endmeta %}
