## Description
How to attach a custom event like onBlur or onKeyDown to the EditorView.

## Solution
This can be achieved by programmatically attaching the desired event and the handler to the EditorView. These events can be attached to the [onMount]({% slug api_editor_editorprops %}#toc-onmount) event of the Editor.

This is an example showcasing how to attach the onBlur event:

{% meta id:index height:760 %}
{% embed_file editor/attach-events/main.jsx preview %}
{% endmeta %}
