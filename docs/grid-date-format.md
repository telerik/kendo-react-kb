## Description

How can I change an ISO date string which I have in my KendoReact Grid? Setting a `format` property does not affect the current date format.

## Solution

The KendoReact Grid formats only valid JavaScript `date` objects. To achieve the desired scenario, parse the ISO strings to JavaScript dates as soon as they are received from the server and work with the parsed data. This approach will also ensure that even if the filtering is done on the client, it will work.
