## Description

How can I set the width of the Grid column based on the content. I want the column width to be set based on the longest value in the column.

## Solution

For the column auto width, we can suggest using a package called [calculate-size](https://www.npmjs.com/package/calculate-size) or similar which will calculate the size of the text based on the font. Then we can use that information to dynamically set the width of the column:

{% meta id:index height:760 %}
{% embed_file grid/auto-width/main.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file shared/products.json %}
{% endmeta %}
