## Description

How can I set the width of the Grid column based on the content. I want the column width to be set based on the longest value in the column.

## Solution

### Using HTML canvas measureText()

In order to automatically calculate the column width, we can suggest using the Canvas API [measureText](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/measureText) function that can calculate the text width based on the font weight, size, and family. Then we can use that information to dynamically set the width of the column.

{% meta id:index height:560 %}
{% embed_file grid/auto-width/canvas/main.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file shared/products.json %}
{% endmeta %}

### Using calculate-size

Another approach would be to use a package called [calculate-size](https://www.npmjs.com/package/calculate-size) or similar which will calculate the size of the text based on the font.

{% meta id:index height:560 %}
{% embed_file grid/auto-width/calculate-size/main.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file shared/products.json %}
{% endmeta %}
